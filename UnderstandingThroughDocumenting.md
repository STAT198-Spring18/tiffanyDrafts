# Understanding Through Documenting
### The importance of seeing how your code fits into the bigger picture and how doucmentation can help facilitate that.

I showed up to badminton practice hoping to have some fun, get some exercise, and make some friends. I instead made a fool of myself, but learned a lot from the experience.

I met someone in my major (highly likely), working in the same lab (highly unlikely). Turns out, he was the student my advisor had in mind when he asked me to modularize my code so he could use it as an example.

"I didn't understand it."

My jaw didn't drop but it basically did. I thought the code was clean, well-modularized, with descriptive function names and even some comments. How hard did he try?

"What does it do?"

At this point, I realized I couldn’t answer his simple question. I had no idea what this program, as a standalone entity, does. If I never processed what my program does, I certainly never conveyed its purpose, and he certainly was right to be confused.

I went into finals exam mode, recalling everything else about the program.

“Okay, so it turns A into B so that we can use B in C,” I pause.

I do my best to quickly repicture the entire script, with my Atom One Dark UI and Syntax Theme and all. I started piecing together the functions I remember writing.

“We take this from A and call X on it to get A’, and then we call Y…”

“Does it go from [high level concept 1] to [high level concept 2] or from [high level concept 2] to [high level concept 1]?” he interrupts, like he has a better idea of what my program does than I do. Still unable to answer, I keep going through my memory of the code.  Eventually, after a lot of starts and stops, 

“It goes from [high level concept 1] to [high level concept 2].” He was happy with my answer, but I was well-aware of how close I was to failing to explain my work.

I had long known that I struggle with just accomplishing my own research tasks, and neglect understanding where my work fits into the bigger picture, but this was the call to action I needed to prioritize this problem. In research, getting tasks done is only part of the bare minimum--with so many research directions, how can anyone trust my research if I don’t have a clear idea of why I am doing what I am doing? The open nature of research means there is no clear path, so each decision needs to be well-justified.

That week, I took time to really understand what exactly and why I was working on this task. I ramped up my documentation for that code to include a short blurb addressing “What does it do?” instead of just “How do you run this?” I realized that documenting my work helps me understand the purpose of the code, and empowers users to better and more quickly understand how the individual lines achieve the ultimate goal. I hope that by continuing to improve my documentation habits, I will become a better researcher and avoid embarrassing encounters like this.
